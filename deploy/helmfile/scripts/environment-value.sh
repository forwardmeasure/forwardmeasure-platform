# Rendered via `helmfile build`, not a raw multi-file yq merge of the
# environment files directly - several are .gotmpl files with unrendered
# Go-template expressions in scalar values, and yq parsing that raw text
# misreads `{{ }}` as YAML flow-mapping syntax, silently corrupting the
# value instead of erroring. Confirmed the hard way via preflight.sh's own
# use of the same pattern (see its fix for the concrete failure mode).
